    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>

    <h2>Here's a little info about myself</h2>

    <p>
      I was a truck driver for 8 years until heal issues made it impossible to continue. I tried out a job working
      at Carrier (the AC company) but the culture there was toxic. Then I tried being a work from home call center
      represenative but figured out pretty quickly that
      wasn't the carrer path for me.
    </p>
    <h2>The main topic: My Computer building hobby</h2>
    <p>
      My main hobby has always building computers. I had an early interest in programming but lacked the modivation
      to persue it. Hardware was much more accessable in terms of learning for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is a picture of my current computer. It's performance sits on the "enthusiast" end of the spectrum.
    </p>

    <h2>Non-exhaustive list of specs</h2>
    <p>
      The case is a Core P5 from Thermaltake with cooling from Corsair. The CPU is an Intel i9 12900KF backed by
      32GB of DDR5 ram. An EVGA 3080 provides 3D graphics prosessing.

    <h3>Updates!</h3>
    <p>Fixed some issues which allowed users to post HTML into page2 (Guestbook). Now it just removes any '<' or '>'
        which pretty much breaks any HTML.</p>
        <p>I've been working on various improvements to the server code. Up until now if a client tried to send a .XML
          to my server, it'd just crash outright. That /should/ be fixed now. </p>
        <p>Note: Haven't made a 404 page so far so if you do something the server doesn't like, it 404's then gives you
          the home page. Didn't want to flashbang anyone with a stark white 404 screen.</p>
        <p>Fixed JSON submission. If the wrong keys are used or no keys are present, it'll just sign with 'not provided'
          in the missing/incorrect fields</p>
        <p>Added some calles to a Weather API. Can put in your city, zip, state and get some current weather info back.
          It's currently really ugly but I'll clean it up eventually.</p>
        <p>Added more API calls. This time the calls are handled by scripts imported by the HTML instead of the server doing it all. It doesn't really run any differently, but mistakes don't crash the server and instead the script crash but the rest of the page keeps working, so that's pretty nice. The Animal pictures are handled with a GET call to a server that returns an object with a image URL. The script appends the URL to the IMG tag already in the HTML. I could have just had the script create the IMG tag on demand, and append it to the HTML but there would have been extra logic required to update a possibly existing IMG tag or it'd just keep appending more and more images to the bottom of the page. That might be cool, but you could just keep clicking and end up with an infinite number of pictures on one page and would require scrolling to the bottom to see the new pictures. Could add logic to append the img to the front, but nah, that would've been more annoying.</p>
        <p>Site is currently under construction. Working on hooking up the Stable Diffusion API from my desktop to my site. The hard part is done, now I just have to do the tedious part of accepting user input and feeding that into the API. Not difficult, just...tedious. Also the weather API is broken, it's a low priority as it was just me experimenting with public APIs.</p>
